# V2 Gloo API Implementation Status

## Overview
I have created a complete foundation for V2 Gloo API support following the same structure as the reqwest implementation. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

## Current Implementation
✅ **Created all API modules:**
- beatmaps.rs
- beatmapsets.rs
- changelog.rs
- chat.rs
- comments.rs
- events.rs
- forum.rs
- matches.rs
- multiplayer.rs
- news.rs
- notifications.rs
- oauth.rs
- ranking.rs
- scores.rs
- search.rs
- users.rs
- wiki.rs

✅ **Created complete client structure** similar to reqwest implementation
✅ **All modules follow the same pattern** as V1 gloo implementation

## Issues That Need Resolution

### 1. Interface Compatibility
Many interface methods don't match the current trait definitions. This requires either:
- Updating the gloo implementations to match the traits exactly
- Creating WASM-specific traits that don't require `Send`

### 2. WASM Send Trait Issue
The main blocker is that gloo-net doesn't support `Send` trait in WASM environments, but the current interfaces require `Send`. Solutions:
```rust
// Option 1: Conditional Send requirement
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
fn method() -> impl Future<Output = Result<T>> + Send;

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
fn method() -> impl Future<Output = Result<T>>;

// Option 2: Separate WASM traits
trait IBeatmapsWasm {
    fn method() -> impl Future<Output = Result<T>>; // No Send requirement
}
```

### 3. Missing Model Structures
Some referenced structures don't exist yet:
- `BeatmapScores` in score module
- `CommentBundle` in comment module
- Various other model structures

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Decide on Send trait strategy** - Choose between conditional compilation or separate WASM traits
2. **Implement missing model structures** or update imports to use existing ones
3. **Update interface methods** to match trait definitions exactly
4. **Test compilation** with `cargo check --features wasm`

## Files Created
All files are located in `src/v2/client/gloo/api/` and follow the same pattern as the reqwest implementations, making it easy to port functionality once the architectural decisions are made.

The foundation is solid - it just needs the interface compatibility and WASM-specific adjustments to be fully functional.
