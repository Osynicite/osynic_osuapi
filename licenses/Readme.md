# Some Usage

- [rosu-v2](https://crates.io/crates/rosu-v2), osynic_osuapi参考了这个库的接口设计和部分类型，项目结构与token机制的实现还是很不一样的，是两个独立的项目
- [rosu-v2](https://crates.io/crates/rosu-v2), osynic_osuapi takes a different approach to the osu! API, focusing on a more idiomatic Rust design. It uses a custom client and has its own set of types and methods for interacting with the API. The two libraries are not directly compatible, but they can be used together in a project if needed.
